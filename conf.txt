## Format of the parameters:
#---------------------------
#   - number of white spaces doesn't matter
#   - lists need to be given with comma between the values. The brakets [] are optional


## General parameters:
#---------------------
# GUI: allows userinput for some of the steps (experimental)
GUI = False

# Configuration file in which the processing of the raw data fits files is defined
configfile_fitsfiles = fits_conf.txt

# subframe: gives the size in x (dispersion axis) and y (cross-dispersion axis), and the starting coordinates in x and y in case only a subframe should be used. Needed when reading files
#           possible formats: can be empty, or
#                             [4250,2838,0,0], or
#                             4250,2838,0,0
subframe        = [4250,2838,0,0]
subframe        = [3056,3056,0,0]

# To extract the data correctly, the frame should be rotated in the way, that traces (dispersion axis) are along vertical direction
#           with wavelength increasing with increasing pixel number (blue on top). 
#           If necessary the image can be flipped after the rotation so that the central wavelength of the orders decreases with increasing 
#           pixel number (blue orders on the right of the (rotated) image and the red orders on the left).
#               format: multiple of 90
# for qsi:          rotate_frame = 270
# for HARPS:        rotate_frame = 180
rotate_frame = 0
flip_frame = False

# In the reduced images mark pixels above max_good_value as saturated
#           format: float or integer
max_good_value  = 63000

# extraction_width_multiplier times the average width of the gaussian fit to the traces of the orders defines how many pixel of either side to extract.
#           format: float or integer
extraction_width_multiplier = 2
arcextraction_width_multiplier = 3
# In order to create a linear wavelength scale, what should the resolution of the scale be in Angstrom (not implemented)
wavelength_scale_resolution = 0.01

## Between observations of different nights the positions of the traces along cross-dispersion axis might change. The pipeline will determine the shift
# maxshift gives the maximum allowed shift between the current sflat and original_master_order_filename.
#           format: float or integer
maxshift = 15
# Also the width of the traces might change. As the measurements are only done on a subsample of the data, the user needs to decide if the new, less precise widths should be used.
update_widths = False

## If the positions of the traces between consecutive observations has changed too much, the orders are searched from scratch and then adjusted.
# bin_search_apertures: Search the apertures of the orders in a binned image. The first value gives the binning along one order (vertical axis, dispersion axis)
#                    and the second value the binning perpendicular to the orders (horizontal, cross-dispersion axis). 
#                    Heavy binning along the dispersion axis is possible in this step, while binning in cross-dispersion needs to be significantly smaller than the minimum separation between orders.
# for qsi:          bin_search_apertures = 20,5
# for HARPS:        bin_search_apertures = 20,2
bin_search_apertures = 20,4
# bin_adjust_apertures: Adjust the center of the apertures in a less binned image. Description as for bin_search_apertures. The second value should be 1 to reach best precission
bin_adjust_apertures = 3,1
# polynom_order_apertures: Order of the polynomial to define the form of the traces along the CCD
polynom_order_apertures = 5


## To determine the background
# background_width_multiplier defines the area which is excluded for determining the background. It has the same settings as extraction_width_multiplier.
# The first value is for the science and the second for the calibration traces
background_width_multiplier = [3, 1]
# polynom_bck defines the orders for a 2d polynomial that is fitted to the background. The first value is for dispersion and the second for cross-dispersion direction.
polynom_bck = [4, 4]

## Finding the traces of the calibration fiber 
# arcshift_side: On which side of the science orders are the corresponding calibration orders located. Possible values are 
#               "left" (towards the redder order), "right" (to the bluer order), or "center" (same position as the science orders
arcshift_side = left
# arcshift_range: Range to search for the shift between the flat traces and arc_traces. This value is determinded by the the script, only in case the process fails the parameter is used.
arcshift_range  = [25, 60]

## The following parameters define the search area when finding the new wavelength solution for the night by using an old solution
# order_offset: Search range to find out by how many orders are the two solutions shifted? Normally the change should be less than 1 Order. The offset will be positive, if bluer orders are added.
order_offset = [-1,1]
# px_offset: search range and step size to find out by how much the central pixel of the orders was shifted. Normally the change should be less than 100 pixel.
px_offset = [-200, 200, 20]
# px_offset_order: Additional shift per order in case big variations happened.
px_offset_order = [-1, 1, 1]
# resultion_offset_pct: Percentage of how much the resolution between the solutions changes. The value is applied in both directions, in total 11 steps will be made. Normally 3 percent should be fine
resolution_offset_pct = 3

## The following parameter define the adjustments made for the wavelength solution. Thereby the process starts with a rugh wavelength solution and ends with a much better one. 5 steps with 10 iterations each are done
# polynom_order_traces: order of a polynomial fit for rugh and final solution to fit the wavelength against line position in each order. Normally [2,4] should be fine. a final value of 3 is not enough to reflect the position of the lines on the CCD
polynom_order_traces = [2,5]
# polynom_order_intertrace: order for rugh and final solution to fit the parameters of the polynomials between the orders. Normally 2,4 should be fine
polynom_order_intertraces = 2,5
# opt_px_range: What fraction around the central pixel of each order should be used to corellate lines in the arc spectrum with the reference spectrum. Normally [0.5, 1.2] is good
opt_px_range = [0.5, 1.2]
# diff_pxs: What is the maximum difference between wavelength solution and reference line in order to assigned the lines together. A good value is 4px, can be higher as sigma-clipping is performed to get rid of badly assigned lines.
diff_pxs = 4
